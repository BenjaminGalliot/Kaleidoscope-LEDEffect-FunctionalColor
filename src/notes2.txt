// Create a method that can do this:
setColor(Key_A, RED);

It will work by creating a matrix of colors:

byte colors[LAYER][ROWS][COLS];

setColor(key, colorindex) {
	//Magic that looks up Key based on name?
	colors[key] = colorindex;

	//Is that all??
}


For coloring individual keys, could I create an array of structs?
Something like:
[{Key_A:red},{Key_B:blue},{Key_C:green}]

Then I can make my groupColorLookup function work by:
 1. Finding all the groupcolors and applying them
 	Then
 2. Going through the array and setting individual key colors from the array of structs
